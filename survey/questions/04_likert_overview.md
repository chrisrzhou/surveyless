## Likert Questions Overview

**[Likert questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale)** are the most widely used questions to study positive and negative scores in surveys.

It usually uses a 5-point or 7-point scale with a neutral option, and is organized from negative to positive (left to right). The most common way of structuring a likert question is to ask a question of the form:

> How **NEGATIVE** or **POSITIVE** are you with **TOPIC**?
